     <p>Hey! My name is Elijah, or Eli for short. 
        <br>I'm originally from Adelaide, however I moved to Sydney to study a bachelor of Audio.
        <br>I decided to pivot my career and try something else, and I've always been interested in programming and software development! 
        <br>I also work as a qualified electrician during the day to pay my rent, however It was not a career I wanted to pursue long term.
        <br>I love playing AFL, video games and producing music!
     </p>
